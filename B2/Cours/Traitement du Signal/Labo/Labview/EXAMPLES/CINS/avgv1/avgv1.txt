This example keeps a running average of the first parameter to CINRun, and outputs this average in the second parameter.	 The average is computed from the two global variables gTotal and gNumElements; the former sums up all floating point inputs, and the latter counts how many inputs there were so the average can be computed at any point in time.

Suppose the CIN is called from more than one place, for example, from two different VIs.  The average for *both* callers is stored in only one place.  This may not be desirable if both VIs are expecting to compute a separate average, independent from the other VI's average.  If a separate average is desired for each VI, see the next example, avgv2...
