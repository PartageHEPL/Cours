Follow the examples in this CINS directory to learn how to call external C code from a LabVIEW diagram using a Code Interface Node (CIN). Each example directory contains simple source code text file(s) and a corresponding VI. Follow the steps described in the LabVIEW Code Interface Reference Manual for this platform to compile the source and load the final code into the Code Interface Node in the VI.
