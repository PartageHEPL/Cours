This example illustrates the use of arrays and clusters.  It takes an array of clusters and a single cluster as inputs.	 Each cluster in this example contains a 16-bit integer and a string.  The CIN returns an array of clusters, a Boolean, and a 32-bit integer.  If the input cluster value is already present in the array of clusters, the CIN sets the Boolean to TRUE and returns the position of the cluster in the array of clusters using the 32-bit integer output.  If the cluster value is not present, the CIN adds it to the array, sets the Boolean output to FALSE, and returns the new position of the cluster in the array of clusters.
