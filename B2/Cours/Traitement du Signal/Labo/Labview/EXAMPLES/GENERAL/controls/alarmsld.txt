Alarmsld.llb shows two different ways to make an alarm slide, a slide that changes color according to its value. Alarm slides are used to alert the operator to values that are outside safety limits. One technique for making an alarm slide uses the slide's attribute node to change the fill color of the slide. Another technique uses a control created in the control editor that combines a slide and a color ramp.
