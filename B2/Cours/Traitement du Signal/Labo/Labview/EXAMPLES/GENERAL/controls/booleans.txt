Booleans.llb contains VIs that demonstrate different aspects of Boolean control behavior. Some of the VIs show how the mechanical action of Boolean controls works. Others show how to recognize which button from a group the user has pressed, including two different ways of making radio buttons, a set of mutually exclusive options. One technique for making radio buttons uses local variables. Another technique uses a slide that was modified in the control editor.
