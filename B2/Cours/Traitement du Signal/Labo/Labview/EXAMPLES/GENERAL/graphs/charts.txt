Charts.llb contains several basic examples of how to use charts in LabVIEW.	 A simple Charts.vi demonstrates different types of charts:	 single and multiplot for both array and single-point input.  The library also contains VIs that demonstrate how to programmatically clear charts, how to implement an XY chart, and how to use the relative-time axis options to display the chart with real time information.
