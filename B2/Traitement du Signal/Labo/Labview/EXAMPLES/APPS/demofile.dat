       LabVIEW in Test and Measurement Applications

The Virtual Instrument (VI) featured here is part of the LabVIEW Test Executive Toolkit.  Using this toolkit, you can control test execution sequences for production and manufacturing test applications.  The Test Executive Toolkit includes a ready-to-run Test Executive application developed in LabVIEW that you can use as delivered or customize to meet your specific requirements.

In addition to your LabVIEW tests, you can also leverage off your existing code by calling Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) and Shared Libraries directly.  The Test Executive allows you to incorporate tests written in many languages, including LabVIEW, LabWindows/CVI, Visual C++, Borland C++, Visual Basic, and others. 

Using LabVIEW, you can also connect to other applications through networking, interapplication communication, and SQL database links.  You can also identify problems and actually improve processes using the LabVIEW Statistical Process Control Toolkit.

Because LabVIEW is a hierarchical programming environment, you can quickly develop test programs that can call several instruments, subprograms (subVIs), and applications.  A key to productivity is the extensive instrument driver libraries.

Similarly, LabVIEW controls our full line of data acquisition (DAQ) hardware.  Because of the increasingly sophisticated instrumentation capabilities of plug-in boards and signal conditioning accessories, these DAQ systems are rapidly becoming cost-effective alternatives to traditional instrumentation.

          LabVIEW for Instrument Control Applications

This virtual oscilloscope demonstrates the flexibility of LabVIEW for instrument control applications.  Using simple graphs, switches, and knobs, you can easily create cost-effective virtual instruments that you can be modify to fit your changing application needs. 

National Instruments is a charter member of the VXIplug&play Systems Alliance, an organization founded to address system level software issues, such as application development environments and instrument drivers, which are beyond the scope of the VXIbus Consortium. Not only can LabVIEW call both WIN and GWIN framework drivers, LabVIEW is the only graphical programming language officially recognized by the VXIplug&play Alliance.

LabVIEW features VI Libraries to control and acquire data from GPIB, VXI, and serial instruments. In addition, LabVIEW currently has more than 450 ready-to-use instrument driver VIs for controlling the most popular GPIB, VXI, and RS-232 instruments from more than 40 different manufacturers.

These driver VIs, available at no charge, are ideal for controlling remote and modular instruments. They consist of intuitive, high-level functions that make it easy for you to control your instruments.

    How to Easily Build Your Applications with LabVIEW

Overview

With LabVIEW, you build Virtual Instruments (VIs) instead of writing programs.  You can quickly create front panel user interfaces, giving you interactive control of your software system.  To specify the functionality, you intuitively assemble block diagrams - a natural design notation for engineers and scientists.  But with LabVIEW, the block diagram is the actual program, so you avoid the time-consuming task of converting ideas into cryptic source code.

Front Panels - The User Interface

On the front panel of your VI, you place the controls and data displays for your system by choosing objects from the Controls menu.  These objects include numeric displays, meters, gauges, thermometers, tanks, LEDs, charts, graphs, and more.  After placing the control objects on your panel, you can arrange and edit them to customize the user interface of your VI.

When your VI is complete, you can use the front panel to control your system - while the VI is running - by clicking a switch, moving a slide, zooming in on a graph, or entering a value from the keyboard.  Meanwhile, the panel comes to life, providing real-time feedback from your system.  You can print this information on your panel or send the data to a file or another application. 

Block Diagrams - The Source Code

To program the VI, you construct the block diagram without worrying about the many syntactical details of conventional programming.  You select objects (icons) from the Functions menu and connect them with wires to pass data from one block to the next.  These blocks range from simple arithmetic functions to advanced acquisition and analysis routines. The blocks can also consist of network and file I/O operations that store and retrieve data in ASCII, binary, and spreadsheet formats.  You can also call programs written in other languages directly from the block diagram.  With LabVIEW, the block diagram is the source code.

Modularity and Hierarchy - Flexibility for All Applications

LabVIEW has a modular design - you can open and run many of the blocks as stand-alone VIs.  You can functionally break down your software system into subcomponents, or subVIs.  You can interactively test these subVIs and use them as icons to build sophisticated layers of VIs.  By creating an icon for your VI and using it in the block diagram of another VI, you can hide complexity in low-level diagrams while retaining access to intermediate values.

Patented Programming Structures

As a complete programming language, LabVIEW offers programming structures such as For loops, While loops, and Case statements for sequential, repetitive, and branching operations.  These structures appear as graphical borders that surround the icons they control.

Dataflow Programming

LabVIEW uses a dataflow programming model that frees you from the linear architecture of text-based languages.  Because the execution order in LabVIEW is determined by the flow of data between blocks and not by sequential lines of text, you can create diagrams that have simultaneous operations.  Consequently, LabVIEW is a multitasking system - running multiple execution threads, multiple VIs, and other applications.

Graphical Compiler 

In many applications, execution speed is critical.  LabVIEW is the only graphical programming system with a compiler that generates optimized code with execution speeds comparable to compiled C programs.  Consequently, you can increase your productivity with graphical programming without sacrificing execution speed.

Powerful Debugging Tools

Unlike many software packages that force you to compile to find errors, LabVIEW immediately indicates incorrect wire connections and lists problems in the Error window.  LabVIEW also features execution highlighting, a single-step mode, wire probes, and breakpoints, so you can trace and monitor the execution flow through the diagram.  LabVIEW programmers appreciate these easy-to-use tools as they develop and debug their applications.

LabVIEW has extensive tools to develop, test, and debug your system.  LabVIEW features two types of help systems.  The built-in, context-sensitive Help window describes each icon and its connections.  LabVIEW also features traditional Online Help, providing instant access to common questions, online manuals, error codes, examples, customer support information, and more.

Ready-to-Run Applications

LabVIEW is shipped with more than 300 example VIs along with a special utility to help you locate exactly what you're looking for.   Some examples are designed to show you very basic LabVIEW concepts.   Many others, however, are functioning applications.  You can make modifications to existing examples to customize them for your application, thus eliminating the need to build a program from scratch.
