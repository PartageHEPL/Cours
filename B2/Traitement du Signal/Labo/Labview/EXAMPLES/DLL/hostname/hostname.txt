  This examples shows how a DLL can use LabVIEW functions.
  The machine.vi calls a DLL that returns the machine name.
The vi then concatenates the machine name with another string
and displays it in a string indicator.
  machine.c contains the c code for the DLL. It first uses a Windows
API call to get the machine name. Then it uses LabVIEW functions to
resize the LabVIEW handle and copy the machine name into the handle.
  machine.mak is a "VC 2.0 for NT" makefile that builds the DLL.
  machine.dll is the actual DLL.
