*******************	 Top Level VIs ***********************

Write Datalog File Example.vi
Creates a new datalog file and writes the specified number of records to the file, then closes it and checks for errors.  Each record is a cluster containing a string and an array of single precision numbers.

Read Datalog File Example.vi
Opens a datalog file created with Write Datalog File Example.vi, reads one record at a time from the file until all are read, then closes the file and checks for errors.  The record is a cluster containing a string and an array of single precision numbers.

Simple Temp Datalog.vi
Reads the temp/time/date cluster datalog file created by Simple Temp Datalogger.  This file format is LabVIEW specific.

Simple Temp Datalogger.vi
Saves the simulated temperature reading and the date the reading was taken in a LabVIEW datalog file.  The datalog file can be read by Simple Temp Datalog Reader.vi.

*******************	 SubVIs ***********************

Acquire Data (Simulated).vi
Generates simulated waveforms given the size n points of the wave.

Close Dlog File+.vi
Closes the data log file on command or when an incoming error occurs and returns the file size at closure.	The file record is a cluster containing one string and one 1D SGL array.

Open/Create/Replace Dlog File.vi
Opens an existing datalog file, creates a new file, or replaces an existing file, programmatically or interactively using a dialog.	 Each record is a cluster containing one string and one 1D SGL array.	 You can optionally specify a dialog prompt, default file name, start path, or filter pattern, and you can specify open and deny modes when opening a file, plus group and permission when creating a new file. Use this VI with the intermediate Write File+ or Read File+ VIs.

Read Dlog File +.vi
Reads a datalog file consisting of a cluster of one string and one 1D SGL array at the specified location; the default location is at the current mark.	 The VI does incoming and internal error checking and does not read if an incoming error occurs.

Write Dlog File+.vi
Writes a datalog file consisting of one string and one 1D SGL array at the specified location; the default location is at the end of file.	 The VI does incoming and internal error checking and does not write if an incoming error occurs.
