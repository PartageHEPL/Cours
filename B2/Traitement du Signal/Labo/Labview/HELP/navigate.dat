=This file contains the text information for the DAQ Navigator. Each entry
in the file should have the following format:

#name:::
[Text]
:::

where,
#         - the index of topic name, found as a look-up table in "Read Text
Info (one file).vi
name   - the topic name
:::        - three colons to denote beginning of text information
[Text]   - The text associated with the topic (brackets [ ] are not
necessary; there MUST be a
              carriage return or line feed before and after the text.
Multiple CR or LF are ignored.
:::        - three colons to denote end of text information

Multi-string entries should look like the following:

#name:::
string1
@@
string2
@@
stringN
:::
Note that @@ symbols should be on their own lines an serve to separate the
strings.
  @@ should not be used before the first string nor after the last string.
